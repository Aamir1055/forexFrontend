# 🔧 DEBUG DEPLOYMENT - Admin Panel Routing Issue

## 🚨 Current Issue:
After login, getting redirected to `http://185.136.159.142/` (broker eye) instead of `http://185.136.159.142/brk-eye-adm/` (admin panel dashboard).

## 🛠️ Debug Version Built:
I've added console logging to track exactly what's happening during redirects.

## 📁 Deploy Debug Version:
1. Copy all files from `dist/` folder to `/brk-eye-adm/` in XAMPP
2. Make sure `.htaccess` is copied

## 🔍 How to Debug:

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
- Press F12 to open developer tools
- Go to Console tab

### Step 2: Test Login Process
1. Visit: `http://185.136.159.142/brk-eye-adm/login`
2. Enter credentials: `admin` / `admin123`
3. Click login
4. **Watch console output** - you should see logs like:
   ```
   🚀 Redirecting to dashboard: /brk-eye-adm/
   🚀 Current location: http://185.136.159.142/brk-eye-adm/login
   🚀 Base path: /brk-eye-adm/
   ```

### Step 3: Check What Happens
- If you see the logs but still get redirected wrong, there's an issue with the redirect
- If you don't see the logs, the login isn't completing successfully
- If you see different paths in the logs, the base path detection is wrong

## 🔧 Quick Fix Options:

### Option 1: Force Absolute URL
If the logs show wrong base path, I can hardcode the production URL.

### Option 2: Check Authentication
If login isn't working, we need to check the auth flow.

### Option 3: Browser Redirect Issue
If logs are correct but redirect is wrong, might be a browser caching issue.

## 📞 Next Steps:
1. Deploy this debug version
2. Test login and check console logs
3. Report what you see in the console
4. I'll provide the exact fix based on the logs

The console logs will tell us exactly where the problem is occurring!
